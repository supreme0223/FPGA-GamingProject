DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190 input pin nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190/C[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#2 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190 input pin nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190/C[1] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#3 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190 input pin nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190/C[2] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#4 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190 input pin nolabel_line91/U3/rom_addr190/C[3] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell nolabel_line91/U2/hc[9]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[0]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[1]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[2]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[3]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[4]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[5]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[6]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[7]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[8]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hc_reg[9]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/hsync_reg/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/vc_reg[0]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/vc_reg[1]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/vc_reg[2]/CLR, nolabel_line91/U2/vc_reg[3]/CLR (the first 15 of 23 listed).

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clkwizard/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.
